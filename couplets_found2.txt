Why wouldn't he be?
He just learned that if you can't afford something, steal it and the police will give it to you for free.

I didn't downvote you.
I don't downvote people I reply to.

I know it's a different tool, but this reminds of my DT teacher at school (read in a thick south yorkshire accent):

"A drill is for drilling.
A mill is for milling.

Wouldn't it be more efficient to have all the piping in one wall?
Or is that not an issue at all?

You obviously have a passion for dog training, maybe use that passion to go check out some seminars and workshops that present methods different from what you're used to.
Challenge what you think you know, and maybe you'll learn something that surprises you.

Should we share n/e with n being a finite number of cultural traits and then stop once we find one that is better than all the ones before?
Like first of all we unlike the secretary problem don't have to decide on one thing, secondly cultural traits aren't finite, third of all you are exactly the kind if dumb ass that this site has gotten a reputation for.

It's more about people not wanting their kids to pick up bad habits and think swearing is acceptable.
Seeing a 5 year old running about swearing is disgusting and unacceptable.

I am so glad my family is chill about it.
The look on a nearby mother's face when a four year old says "Well shit!"

I’ve taught my kids that swearing is “aggressive” language, and as they grow, they will learn the proper time and place to use it.
Now go the fuck to sleep you little shits!

Pretty much it's the same thing I said.
Except I use "strong" instead.

People are staying in college longer more than they used to.
A lot might also be starting later too.
