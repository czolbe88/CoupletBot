As long as you did not explicitly 
 tell the interviewer at the VA that you have no interest in becoming a commando and you get the enlistment letter to report to Pasir Ris Camp there should be no reason for the SAF to pull you out of CDO BMT at least not before you even enlist especially 
 after you have shown the physical ability to have your NS cut by 8 weeks and also considering the drop out rate from CDO training

 you get to the cleanest beach in Penang

Step 1 Parachute someone from the military Paper General just like General Ng from SPH Step 2 Straits Times writing a news article that this person 
 takes the MRT to work and knows his job as CEO of SMRT Step 3 Breakdown will still happen 
 and that person still gets his her million salary

At this point 
 I think nobody would mind SMRT importing foreign talent 
 as long as he she can get the bloody job done

No it is not because if the rot is really in middle management 
 your new AMDK CEO will fire them and is left with no choice but to pick workers up from insert 3rd world country here because it's a job that Singaporeans don't want 
 to do
